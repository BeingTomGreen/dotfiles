## Dotfiles

Since I develop mainly in Windows, these are somewhat lacking, but it works for me.

These are heavily based on other peoples dotfiles, particularly those of [Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Charlie Somerville](https://github.com/charliesome/conf).

I'm always open to suggestions!

#### Config

If you want to use a global `.gitignore` file you will need to configure your `.gitconfig` file to point to file:

```
    [core]
      excludesfile = /path/to/.gitignore
```

See my [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/BeingTomGreen/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig) as an example.
