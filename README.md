## Dotfiles

Since I in the process of dropping Windows they are still somewhat lacking.

These are heavily based on other peoples dotfiles, particularly those of [Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Charlie Somerville](https://github.com/charliesome/conf).

#### Config

If you want to use a global `.gitignore` file you will need to configure your `.gitconfig` file to point to file:

```
    [core]
      excludesfile = /path/to/.gitignore
```
