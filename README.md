My dotfiles, since I generally use Windows they are somewhat lacking. I will get around to dropping Windows at somepoint..

These are heavily based on other peoples dotfiles, particularly [Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/git/aliases.zsh) and [Charlie Somerville](https://github.com/charliesome/conf/blob/master/config/bash_profile#L92).
